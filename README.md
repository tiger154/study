# Basic knowledge

  1. Big-O 
     - In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows 
     
     1) O(1) : HashTable - Only once step     
     2) O(log2n) : Binary search
     3) O(n) : Linear search
     4) O(nlog2n) : Between O(n) and O(n2) But much smaller 
     5) O(n^2): Linear search with for inner for
     6) O(n^3) :
  
  2. log2n  

      - 수학에서 이진 로그 (binary logarithm)는 밑이 2인 로그이다. log 2  또는 lb[1]로 표기하며, 2의 거듭제곱의 역함수이다. 
        양의 실수 n과 실수 x에 대하여 x = log 2 n은 2x = n이라는 것과 같다.
      - ex) log 2 1 = 0, log 2 2 = 1, log 2 4 = 2, log 2 32 = 5




* Resources
  - Even if you don't go to any of these colleges, might as well copy the curriculum at top universities, since they have proven to work and the content is mostly public anyway.
CS61B and CS170 at UC Berkeley, 
CS50 at Harvard, 
6.006 at MIT(MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Fall 2011), 
15-121 at Carnegie Mellon,
or the appropriate classes at Waterloo, Stanford, CalTech, Princeton, etc. (not sure what the're called)
